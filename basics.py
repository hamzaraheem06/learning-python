# formatted string
# Hamza, like in javascript you can use `` to inject variables in a string, in Python you can do that by using f with the starting quotation of the string to tell the compiler this is a special type of string that you want to format in your way.

# name = input("What is your name? ").strip().title() input is a function that allow us to take an input value from the user. It returns whatever user types in a str format.
#
# nameSize = len(name)

# print(f"Hello, {name}") # print is a function that allow us to write some value on the terminal
# print(name.count('a', 0, len(name))) for counting the number of times a substring occurs in a string
# print(name.endswith('b')) # to check if a string ends with a specific character(s), you can also use this for a specific location in the string with start and end parameters.
# print("H\tA\tM\tZ\tA".expandtabs(tabsize=8)) Hamza you are intelligent you can understand this

# name = input("What is your name? ").strip()
# print(name.isalpha())

# name = "Hamza Raheem"
# names = [first, last] = name.split(" ")
# print(names[1])

# print(name.rfind('a', 0, len(name))) finds looks for a specific character(s) in a string, returns the index of the first instance, else returns -1 if there is no instance of the character(s) in the string

# message = "Hello, Hamza!"
